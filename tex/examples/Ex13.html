<h3>Example 13</h3>
Let G be the group generated by the two matrices below.
Calculate the "graph of inclusions" for the geometric class
given by G.

<pre>
3x3
 1  0  0
 1 -1  0
 0  0 -1
3x3
 -1 1 0
 -1 0 0
  0 0 1
</pre>


<h3>Used Programs</h3>

<a href="../progs/Order.html">Order</a>,
<a href="../progs/Graph.html">Graph</a>



<h3>Solution</h3>

<ol>

<li>
Write the two matrices in a file 'G' and add 
<pre>
  #g2
</pre>
as top row. Call
<pre>
   Order -o G >> G
</pre> to get the group with the correct order in file '<a href="./Ex13_G">G</a>'.
</li>

<li>
Call
<pre>
   Graph G
</pre>
to get the following output:
<pre>

father: level 1 number of orbits 1 lengths 2
There are 3 Z-classes with 2 1 2 affine classes!

1: 1 (4, 1, 2^2)

2: 2 (2, 1, 2^1)
2: 2 (4, 1, 2^2)
1: 3 (18, 1, 3^1)
1: 4 (9, 1, 3^1)
2: 5 (9, 1, 3^1)

4: 4 (4, 1, 2^2)
4: 4 (3, 1, 3^1)  5 (6, 1, 3^1)
5: 5 (2, 1, 2^1)
5: 5 (4, 1, 2^2)

The program first gives the number of arithmetic/Z-classes in the geometric class
and the number of affine classes in each arithmetic class.<br>
The affine classes are consecutively numbered. The first affine class 
of each arithmetic class consits of symmorphic space groups
(affine classes 1,3 and 4).<br>
A row
<pre>
   s: r (u, o, i)  R (U, O, I)
</pre>
has the following meaning:<br>
There is an edge from the affine class r to the affine class s
with label i<sub>u</sub><sup>o</sup> and an edge form the 
affine class R to the affine class s with label I<sub>U</sub><sup>O</sup>
(i.e.: the index in the group-subgroup-relationship is I, the length of the 
orbit of the affine normalizer on the supergroups is O and the orbit of
the affine normalizer on the subgroups has length U).<br>
The matrix shows the edges of the graph. The 3 in the forth line and the 
forth column means, that there are three edges from the affine class with 
number 4 to itself. The 1 in the forth row and the first column means, that
there is one edge from the affine class with number 4 to the affine class with number 1.
</li>

<li>
The following picture visualizes the graph (if there are several edges between two affine
classes, only one is drawn with the labels of all of them):<br>
