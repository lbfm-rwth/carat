Please input the symbol for the crystal-family: 6-1
The crystal-family 6-1 contains 6 homogeneously decomposable bravais-groups with
 1,  1,  1,  1,  1,  1
 Z-classes of Bravais groups.
Do you want to calculate bravais-groups? (y or n): Please input a filename (stdout = standard output): Which bravais-groups should be printed? (a(ll) or s(election): Please enter index i of homogeneously decomposable bravais-group, 1<= i<= 6: Please enter index j of bravais-group belonging to this homogenously decomposable
1 <= j =< 1: #g2 f1 n1 c1% homogeneously decomposable bravais-group
